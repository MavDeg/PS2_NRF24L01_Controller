# PS2_NRF24L01_Controller
This is one of the small projects I built some years ago (2017). 
A modified PS2 controller with NRF24L01+ transceiver with a claimed range of at least 100meters (note: it is much shorter than that :-)).  

I have used it then to control a cheap miniature RC Humvee, which I modified with proportional throttle (sec) and steering (servo).
